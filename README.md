##  Telecom Churn Prediction Case Study

###  Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning classification models. With 21 predictor variables, the aim is to identify customers likely to leave the service so the company can proactively reduce churn and improve customer retention.

---

### Problem Statement

Telecom companies often struggle with customer retention. In this case study, the goal is to analyze customer data and build a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a customer will churn (i.e., switch providers).

---

###  Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographics, account details, and service usage information.

**Key Features Include:**

* `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`
* `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
* Service-related: `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `TechSupport`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`
* Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed churn distribution across various demographic and service categories.
* Identified high churn rates among month-to-month contract customers, those without tech support, and customers with shorter tenure and higher charges.

---

###  Modeling Techniques

Applied classification algorithms:

* Logistic Regression

**Model Evaluation Metrics:**

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* ROC-AUC Curve

###  Best Model

\[logm3 ]
Performance:

* **Accuracy:** \[e.g., 78%]
* **ROC-AUC:** \[e.g., 0.84]

---

###  Key Insights

* Customers with **month-to-month contracts**, **short tenure**, and **high monthly charges** are most likely to churn.
* Value-added services (e.g., online security, tech support) are associated with lower churn rates.
* Long-term contract types significantly improve customer retention.

---

###  Business Recommendations

* Encourage customers to switch to annual or two-year contracts.
* Offer loyalty rewards for long-tenure customers.
* Provide value-added service bundles (e.g., security, tech support) as part of retention strategy.

---

### Limitations & Future Work

* The model does not incorporate real-time data or customer sentiment.
* Adding behavioral signals and survey feedback could further improve performance.
* Future work could include deploying a real-time churn dashboard or using ensemble models for better accuracy.

---

###  Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
